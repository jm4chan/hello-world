Kiwi workout.

Janis prepared the ingredients for tonight's dinner. While rolling sushi we began a discussion about lunch. "Lucky you, eating leftovers and not complaining," she exclaimed. "Mom only packs lunch for Dad. I was starving at work." For some reason my sister's observation caused me to start laughing uncontrollably. I thought to myself, Did you even cook in college? How can you not know how to prepare your own lunch box? 

I love my family.
